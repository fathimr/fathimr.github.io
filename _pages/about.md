I am a third-year PhD student at the University of Toronto, specializing in Operations Research and Machine Learning within the Decision Optimization and Reinforcement Learning (DORL) lab at the Mechanical and Industrial Engineering department. 

My research focuses on integrating Machine Learning and Operations Research to enhance optimization models for solving complex decision-making problems. I am particularly interested in the theoretical guarantees of these integrations to ensure high-quality solutions. My work mainly applies to supply chain management and healthcare sectors, areas where effective optimization can drive significant improvements.

I am passionate about continuous learning and enjoy sharing knowledge through teaching, striving to make complex concepts accessible to others. My goal is to leverage my expertise to develop innovative solutions that address real-world challenges in various industries.
